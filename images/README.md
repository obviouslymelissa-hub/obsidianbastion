# images

This folder contains images used by index.html in the site root.

Expected filenames (case-sensitive):
- ship-header.jpg
- ship-1.jpg
- ship-2.jpg
- ship-3.jpg

Place your image files here and commit them to the same branch that GitHub Pages uses (commonly `main` or `gh-pages`). After pushing, the images will be available at `https://obviouslymelissa-hub.github.io/obsidianbastion/images/<filename>`.

Tips:
- Use the exact filenames and letter case used in index.html.
- You can replace the placeholder images by uploading photos with those names.
- If you want me to add placeholder images for you, tell me which branch to push to and I can add small example PNG/JPG files.
