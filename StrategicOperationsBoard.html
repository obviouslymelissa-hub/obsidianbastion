            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                The Strategic Operations Board serves as the Fleet’s top command authority. It’s where major decisions are made — mission approvals, star designations, and the overall direction for the ships operating under our banner. Some of those ships are well-known. Others remain intentionally out of sight, mentioned only in secure channels.
                The Board is presented as a council of senior officers, but its guidance ultimately reflects the leadership of the presiding General, who ensures every vessel — including the Obsidian Bastian — stays aligned with the Fleet’s goals and standards.
